# CyberVets_ePortfolio
Welcome to my CyberVets ePortfolio!
I am apinste, CyberVets Cohort 6 member. I have degrees in Biology and Nursing, and I am finishing my graduate degree in Cybersecurity Management and Policy at UMGC. I am a Hospital Corpsman, also known as a "medic", for the United States Navy.  For 4 years, I served at the President's hospital as a Program Administrator where I improved processes for maximum efficiency and administrative output. Before my military service, I served as a Montessori educator where I specialized in bringing out a child's genius. In my life, I've been given the honor of being the first female master of a Filipino martial art called Pekiti Tirsia Kali, a closed quarter combat system that deals with edged and impact weapons. I teach and lead a community of practitioners in Maryland for about 10 years now, under a business that I own. I joined the CyberVets program because it is the best Veteran transition program available for someone like me who is eager to excel and contribute in the Cybersecurity industry. I'm grateful for this opportunity. 
Thank you very much!
